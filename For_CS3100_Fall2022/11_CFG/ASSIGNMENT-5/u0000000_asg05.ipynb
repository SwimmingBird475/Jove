There you'll notice that you are given a Jove-based parser that parses expressions and calculates expressions. You'll be asked to compare this parser against Python's parser (by running Python on those expressions). If there are answer-differences, you are asked to look at the parse-trees generated by Jove and find out why you got Jove's answers. Then by suitably parenthesizing the Python expressions, you'll know what precedences Python assigned. \n",
