* -------------------------------------------------------

* Week-1 **Reading**: Chapters 1, 2, 3. __Outcomes:__
  Emerge with complete understanding of the basics of
  computability, why studying formal language matters, and know how to construct
  languages using set operations, concatenation, and exponentiation. They also
  begin studying Kleene-star. As for practical matters, they understand the course
  objectives, how to run the course software and submit the required material for
  grades.

   - 1:8/22
     - Run the Notebooks within 01_Computability_Languages/ 
     - Quiz-1 covers L1,2
     - Asg-1  covers L1,2

     - Run the Notebooks within 01_Computability_Languages/
   
* Week-2 **Reading**: Chapters 3, 4 (except 4.6 thru 4.8), 5, 6. __Outcomes:__
  Finish understanding Kleene-star, and are able to design
  DFA using two methods: By knowing how to encode salient information in DFA states
  (by naming DFA states to retain this info) and by Boolean operations on DFA (union,
  intersection, complement). They know how to document DFA using literate-programming
  methods of annotating comments within a simple DFA markdown. They are able to
  automatically build, and test DFA, following important principles of software testing.

     - Run the Notebooks within 03_Advanced_DFA/

* Week-3 **Reading** Chapter 6 (skip 6.4 and 6.5), 7.  __Outcomes:__
Outcomes: Understand the importance of nondeterminism in computer
  science, and what nondeterministic finite-state automata are. They understand how to
  convert NFA to DFA via subset construction. They are able to witness, through actual
  hands-on activity, that NFA can blow up exponentially when converted to DFA. They
  may also obtain a DFA directly, and check against results from NFA2DFA using a
  DFA graph isomorphism check, thus showing the power of the Myhill-Nerode theorem to
  help check one software construction method against the other, to catch bugs.

* Week-4 **Reading** Chapter 8, 9.  __Outcomes:__
  Understand what regular expressions are, and how they
  can be converted into NFA, and back to RE. They understand all the algorithmic
  details, solving interesting real-world problems using regular expressions, including
  error-correcting finite-state machines, and the encoding of the Postage Stamp Problem
  (also known as the Coin Problem).
